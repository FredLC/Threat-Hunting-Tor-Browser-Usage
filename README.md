# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Hunt Report: Suspected Tor Browser Activity on Endpoint

## üìã Summary
  
- **Date:** *March 22, 2025*  
- **Environment:** Windows 10 Endpoint (Lab Simulation)  
- **Objective:** Investigate potential use of the Tor Browser to anonymize outbound traffic and evade monitoring controls.

---

## üìñ Situation

During a routine review of outbound network activity, I was tasked to investigate a potential case of anonymized traffic from a corporate endpoint. The concern was that a user may be using the **Tor Browser** to bypass internal content filtering and security monitoring ‚Äî behavior that is often associated with unauthorized or high-risk activity.

This investigation simulated a real-world threat scenario where Tor is used for encrypted communications, potential Command and Control (C2) traffic, or dark web access.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Threat Simulation

To assess our detection coverage, I replicated Tor usage in a lab environment:

- Downloaded and executed the **Tor Browser Bundle**
- Observed host-level telemetry with **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**
- Monitored process behavior and outbound network activity
- Cross-referenced known **Tor exit node IPs** from [https://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses](https://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses)

---

## üéØ Detection Strategy

My detection and hunting approach focused on the following signals:

- **Process Execution:** `firefox.exe` running from the `Tor Browser` install directory
- **Unusual Network Ports:** Outbound traffic to **port 9050, 9001, 9150, 9030**
- **Known Exit Nodes:** Traffic to IPs from the public Tor exit node list

## üîç Hunting Queries (Microsoft Defender)

### 1. Unusual Firefox Execution Path (Tor Browser)

```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName in~ ("firefox.exe", "tor.exe")
| where FolderPath has "Tor Browser"
```

### 2. Outbound Traffic to Known Tor Ports

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemotePort in (9001, 9030, 9050, 9051, 9150, 9151, 8443, 7070, 8118, 5000, 9100, 9005)
```

### 3. Traffic to Known Tor Exit Nodes

```kusto
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where RemoteIP in~ (
    "185.220.101.1", "51.254.45.15", "204.13.200.2", "185.220.100.254"
	...
)
```

## üß† Findings
- Process Behavior: firefox.exe launched from a user-accessible path linked to the Tor Browser (C:\Users\labuser\Desktop\Tor Browser\...)

- Network Activity: Connections observed on ports 9100 and 9005, which are ports associated with Tor network traffic

- Exit Node Traffic: Outbound connections matched known Tor IPs from the official list


## üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations
Block: Prevent execution of unauthorized anonymizers like Tor via Defender ASR or AppLocker

Alert: Set custom alerts on traffic to Tor ports or IPs

Monitor: Review process paths and network activity for unusual encryption or proxy behavior

Educate: Train end users on acceptable use policies and the risks of anonymizing tools in a corporate environment
